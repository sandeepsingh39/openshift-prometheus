# Prometheus in OpenShift

This repository contains definitions and tools to run Prometheus and its associated ecosystem on Red Hat OpenShift.

## Components

The following components are available:

* link:https://prometheus.io/docs/introduction/overview/[Prometheus]
* link:https://prometheus.io/docs/instrumenting/exporters/[node-exporter]
* link:https://prometheus.io/docs/alerting/alertmanager/[Alertmanager]

## Project Organization

A new project called _prometheus_ will be created to contain the entire ecosystem.

Execute the following command to create the project:

[source,bash]
----
oc new-project prometheus --display-name="Prometheus Monitoring"
----

Make sure that there is not a default node selector on the project:

[source,bash]
----
oc annotate namespace prometheus openshift.io/node-selector=""
----

## Deploy Prometheus

Starting with OpenShift 3.6 the OpenShift routers expose a metrics endpoint on port 1936. For Prometheus to be able to monitor the routers this port needs to be open.

Additionally Prometheus does not work with remote volumes (NFS, EBS, ...) but needs local disk storage as well. This means we need to create a directory on (one of) the infranodes. The Prometheus template includes a Node Selector `prometheus-host=true` - so we need to set the correct label on the infranode(s) as well.

Run the following Ansible playbook to configure the infranodes:

[source,bash]
----
ansible-playbook -i /etc/ansible/hosts ./setup_infranodes.yml
----

The router also requires basic authentication to be allowed to scrape the metrics. Find the router password by executing the following command:

[source,bash]
----
oc set env dc router -n default --list|grep STATS_PASSWORD|awk -F"=" '{print $2}'
----

An OpenShift template has been provided to streamline the deployment to OpenShift.

Execute the following command to instantiate the Prometheus template using the previously retrieved router password as a parameter:

[source,bash]
----
oc new-app -f prometheus.yaml --param ROUTER_PASSWORD=<Router Password>
----

Since Prometheus needs to use a local disk to write its metrics add the `privileged` SCC to the *prometheus* service account:

[source,bash]
----
oc adm policy add-scc-to-user privileged system:serviceaccount:prometheus:prometheus
----

Make sure your Prometheus pod is running (on an Infranode):

[source,bash]
----
oc get pod -o wide
----

## Next Steps

# Cleanup

Delete the project and the cluster-reader binding (which gets created by the template but doesn't get deleted as part of the project):

[source,bash]
----
oc delete project prometheus
oc delete clusterrolebinding prometheus-cluster-reader
oc adm policy remove-scc-from-user privileged prometheus
----

You will also need to clean up the directory /var/lib/prometheus-data on the Infranode(s) and remove the label `prometheus-host=true` from the Infranode(s).
